#Group 3 Project submission for Software Engineering Module

# The group was tasked with delivering a virtual board game to be played through the console of an Integrated 
# Development Environment (IDE); in this case, Eclipse IDE, and utilising a natural language interface. The board game’s 
# is based on NASA’s Artemis mission to land the first woman and next man on the moon but reflects a simplified 
# representation of some of the challenges faced by the mission as the object of the game’s gameplay and story. With 
# this, the group employed a use-case driven development process to produce an object-oriented solution to the 
# outlined requirements.
